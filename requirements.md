# **Revenium React Developer Take-Home Project**

## **Project: Real-Time AI FinOps Dashboard**

### **Overview**

Build a real-time dashboard for monitoring AI usage and costs across multiple customers and tenants. This system will display streaming metrics, detect anomalies, and provide interactive cost analysis tools—all while maintaining smooth performance with high-frequency data updates.

### **Time Expectation**

This is designed as a weekend project (8-12 hours). We value quality over completeness \- focus on demonstrating deep technical understanding rather than building every feature.  

***Once the project is complete, please share the link to its GitHub repository.***

## **Business Context**

Our platform provides real-time visibility into AI and API costs. Finance teams, engineering leads, and product managers use our dashboards to track token usage, detect cost anomalies, and understand spending patterns across different models, customers, and time periods. The dashboard must handle hundreds of metric updates per second while remaining responsive and easy to use.

## **Technical Requirements**

### **Core Components**

#### **1\. Real-Time Metrics Dashboard**

Build a **responsive dashboard** that displays:

**Primary Metrics Panel:**

```ts
interface MetricUpdate {
  timestamp: string;
  tenantId: string;
  customerId: string;
  metrics: {
    totalCalls: number;
    totalTokens: number;
    totalCost: number;
    avgLatencyMs: number;
  }
}
```

**Required Visualizations:**

* **Live cost gauge** \- Current spend rate ($/hour) with animated updates  
* **Token usage time series** \- Last 5 minutes of token consumption with 5-second resolution  
* **Cost by model chart** \- Breakdown showing GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude, etc.  
* **Top customers table** \- Real-time sorted list of highest spenders  
* **Anomaly alerts panel** \- Shows detected cost spikes or unusual patterns

#### **2\. Data Connection & Updates**

Implement a **polling-based data fetch** system that:

* Polls a REST endpoint at configurable intervals (default: every 2 seconds)  
* Handles API failures gracefully with exponential backoff retry logic  
* Manages polling state (pause/resume updates)  
* Implements client-side buffering to smooth bursty data updates  
* Provides connection status indicators (connected, error, retrying)  
* Allows users to adjust polling frequency (1s, 2s, 5s, 10s)

**Mock Server**: You'll create a simple Node/Express or Python server that provides a REST endpoint returning mock metric updates.

**Required Endpoints:**

```ts
// GET /api/metrics?since=<timestamp>
// Returns metrics since the last poll
{
  metrics: MetricUpdate[];
  nextPollAfter: number; // milliseconds
}

// GET /api/metrics/history?from=<timestamp>&to=<timestamp>
// Returns historical data for time range selection
```

---

**Bonus/Extra Credit: Real-Time Streaming Implementation**

For additional consideration, implement **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** or **WebSocket** as an alternative to polling:

* Automatic fallback to polling if streaming is unavailable  
* Connection status indicators specific to streaming  
* Proper cleanup on component unmount  
* Exponential backoff for reconnection attempts  
* Handle browser tab visibility (pause when hidden, resume when visible)

This demonstrates advanced real-time system architecture but is not required for the core assignment.

#### **3\. Anomaly Detection Visualization**

Implement a **visual anomaly detection** system:

* Show trend lines   
* Display contextual information on hover (what caused the spike?)  
* Allow users to dismiss or acknowledge anomalies  
* Persist acknowledged anomalies (localStorage is fine for this exercise)

#### **4\. Time Window Controls**

Implement **flexible time window** selection:

* Preset options: Last 5 min, 15 min, 1 hour, 24 hours  
* Custom date range picker  
* Real-time mode vs. historical mode toggle  
* Playback controls for historical data (play/pause/speed)

## **Technology Stack**

### **Required Technologies**

* **React 18+** with hooks  
* **TypeScript** (strict mode)  
* **Vite** as build tool  
* **Your choice of:**  
  * Charting library (Recharts, Highcharts, Chart.js, D3, or similar)  
  * State management (Context \+ useReducer, Zustand, Jotai, Redux Toolkit, or similar)  
  * UI component library (Radix UI, ShadCN UI, MUI, or similar)

### **Mock Backend Server**

* Simple **Node/Express** server (or use Vite server capabilities) or **Python** server  
* Generates realistic streaming data  
* Includes a few REST endpoints for initial data load

### **Docker Requirements**

* **Dockerfile** for the React application  
* **docker-compose.yml** that includes both frontend and mock backend  
* Optimized production build  
* Multi-stage build to minimize image size
